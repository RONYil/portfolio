# üß≠ ML Automatic Pathfinding

A basic machine learning demo that performs automatic pathfinding using decision logic or simulation.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ Key Features
- Simple logic-based path optimization
- Interactive simulation in notebook
- Can be extended to grid maps, mazes, or games

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Car_deployment_2_classfication folder
Which includes
## a. Folders for training and validation sets
## b. auto_category is used to automatically classify data according to the classification criteria in test
## c. Deploy_2 is used to test the deployment of binary classification models
## d. model_set2 is used to train binary classification models
## e. test -deployment2 is also a test deployment
## f. test contains methods for classifying images
## g. madpoint.csv is used for the short answer analysis of simple_analysis

Car_deployment_muti_classfication folder
Which includes
a. Folders for training and validation sets
b.alysis_model 3 Simply analyzes and tests the performance of the model
c.Depoy_3 is used to test the deployment of binary classification models
d. model_set3 is used to train muti classification models
e.test -deployment3 is also a test deployment

deploy folder include all the process for deployÔºàcan be saw in the deploy folder's readme.txtÔºâ

training folder include some training process of the model

transfer folder include the way we transfer picture into the type we want
first cut the picture
seconde transfer the picture into black and white
