# 🧭 ML Automatic Pathfinding

A basic machine learning demo that performs automatic pathfinding using decision logic or simulation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Key Features
- Simple logic-based path optimization
- Interactive simulation in notebook
- Can be extended to grid maps, mazes, or games

## ▶️ How to Run

### 📁 Car_deployment_2_classification folder

Includes:

- Folders for training and validation sets  
- `auto_category` is used to automatically classify data according to the classification criteria  
- `Deploy_2` is used to test the deployment of binary classification models  
- `model_set2` is used to train binary classification models  
- `test-deployment2` is also a test deployment  
- `test` contains methods for classifying images  
- `madpoint.csv` is used for the short answer analysis of `simple_analysis`
